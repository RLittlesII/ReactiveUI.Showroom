# RefreshView Demo

The Xamarin.Forms `RefreshView` is a container control that provides pull-to-refresh functionality for scrollable content. Therefore, the child of a `RefreshView` must be a scrollable control, such as `ScrollView`, `CollectionView`, or `ListView`.

This sample demonstrates using a `RefreshView` to refresh data that's displayed in a `FlexLayout` that's the child of a `ScrollView`.

For more information about this sample, see [Xamarin.Forms RefreshView](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/refreshview).
